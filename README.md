How the Program Works:
The program generates a random integer between 1 and 100.

It asks the user to enter their guess and compares it with the generated number.

Based on the user's guess:

If it’s too low, the program responds with "Too low! Try again."

If it’s too high, it responds with "Too high! Try again."

When the user guesses correctly, the program congratulates them and displays the number of attempts taken.

This game will continue until the correct guess is made, so the user has unlimited tries.
